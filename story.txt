Frau Melhase and I were heading to the Rammstein concert in our Porsche when she told me that we had forgotten our lederhose and bratwurst. 
We decided to go back to retrieve them and also to grab some brot, so we made a u-turn and went back down the hauptstrasse. 
We stopped by the baeckerei to get the brot, and decided to also get some gebaeck and apfelkuchen. 
After getting home and retrieving our lederhose, we decided to bring our hund and got back into our porsche. 
It got hot in the porsche so I turned on the klimmaanlage.
We arrived at the concert a few hours early so we decided to go to a nearby biergarten for a drink and a snack before heading inside.
But the biergarden didn't allow hunds, so we decided to try the baeckerei instead.
